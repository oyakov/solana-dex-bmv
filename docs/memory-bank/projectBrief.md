# Project Brief: BMV Eco System Market Making Bot

The BMV Eco System Market Making Bot is a sophisticated algorithmic trading system designed for the Solana blockchain. Its primary purpose is to provide liquidity and price stability for the BMV token on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

## Core Mission
- **Long-term Price Stabilization**: Smooth out volatility and prevent sudden price crashes.
- **Upward Trend Maintenance**: Support an organic upward price trajectory.
- **Liquidity Protection**: Ensure there is always a deep market for BMV.
- **Capital Accumulation**: Reinvest trading profits back into the liquidity pool to strengthen the market.

## Key Strategies
- **Dynamic Pivot Grid**: Built around a dynamically calculated "Break-even Point" (Pivot Point).
- **Asymmetric Channel**: 15% Buy zone and 30% Sell zone to manage market perception and absorb selling pressure.
- **Stealth Operation**: Multi-wallet rotation and randomized action timing to hide the presence of a single large market maker.
- **MEV Protection**: Full integration with Jito Bundles to prevent front-running and ensure transaction priority.
- **Risk Controls**: Includes a "Fiat Floor" (USD-pegged price support) and "Target Control PCT" (maintaining majority token control).
