# Product Context: BMV Eco System Market Making Bot

## Why This Product Exists
New token ecosystems on Solana (and other chains) often suffer from:
1. **Extreme Volatility**: Small buy/sell orders causing massive price swings.
2. **Sniper Bots**: Automated attackers draining liquidity at launch or during thin order books.
3. **Lack of Liquidity**: Deterring organic investors who fear they cannot exit positions.
4. **Market Manipulation**: External actors trying to drive price down to accumulate cheaply.

The BMV ES Market Making Bot solves these problems by acting as a "Lighthouse" and "Shield" for the ecosystem.

## Problems It Solves
- **Market Integrity**: By maintaining an OpenBook order grid, it provides a "source of truth" for the token's value.
- **Investor Confidence**: Deep buy walls (especially at the "Fiat Floor") give investors confidence that the price is supported.
- **Efficient Rebalancing**: Automatically settles funds and re-targets the grid after setiap trade, maintaining optimal market depth.
- **Strategic Control**: Allows the project team to maintain control over the circulating supply (via Target Control PCT).

## User Goals
- **Ecosystem Developers**: Secure a stable financial environment for the BMV project.
- **Token Holders**: Protection from flash crashes and assurance of a liquid market.
- **Traders**: A reliable market environment with predictable spreads and depth.
