# v0.4.0 Feature Overview: Backlog Implementation Sprint

Version 0.4.0 represents a major milestone in the BMV Eco System development, specifically targeting "Stealth" and "Financial Autonomy" as outlined in Requirement v2.7.

## 1. Swarm Grid Segmentation (BMV-50)
The bot now supports distributing its total order grid across multiple sub-wallets.
- **32-Order Limit**: Automatically segments the grid to respect the Solana/OpenBook limit of 32 open orders per user-market.
- **Swarm Orchestration**: A central manager coordinates order placement across `N` wallets to maintain a unified asymmetric grid.

## 2. Dynamic Wallet Rotation & Stealth (BMV-46)
To minimize the on-chain footprint and prevent detection by "whale watchers" or copy-traders:
- **Periodic Rotation**: Sub-wallets are rotated based on time and volume thresholds.
- **Randomized Delays**: Execution timing is jittered with millisecond precision to emulate human-like activity.

## 3. SOL Auto-injection & Financial Manager (BMV-53)
The `FinancialManager` ensures consistent operation without manual intervention:
- **Balance Monitoring**: Monitors SOL balances across all sub-wallets.
- **Automated Refills**: Injects SOL from a master funding wallet when a sub-wallet's balance drops below operational thresholds (e.g., 0.05 SOL).
- **Rent Recovery**: Automatically recovers rent from closed accounts and stale orders.

## 4. Proximity-based Rebalance (BMV-51)
Optimization of the rebalancing logic to reduce unnecessary transaction fees:
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Rebalancing is triggered based on the "proximity" of the current market price to the active grid levels rather than a fixed time interval or global pivot shift.

## 5. L2 Orderbook Scan & Front-running Protection (BMV-52)
Enhanced market awareness via real-time L2 depth analysis:
- **Slab Parsing**: Direct parsing of OpenBook Slab data for low-latency depth monitoring.
- **Imbalance Index**: Calculates the buy/sell pressure imbalance to anticipate short-term price movements.
- **Front-running Guard**: Detects suspicious large orders entering the book and adjusts the grid proximity accordingly.

## 6. RugCheck Monitoring (BMV-14)
Safety-first integration with the RugCheck API:
- **Pre-trade Verification**: Every token mint is scanned for common risks (mint disable, freeze authority, liquidity locks).
- **Automated Approval**: Only tokens passing the "Good" or "Excellent" score thresholds are traded.

## 7. Advanced Dashboard (D3 Upgrades)
The web observability layer has been completely refactored using D3.js:
- **High-Precision Charts**: Support for 8+ decimal places in tooltips.
- **Market Depth Visualization**: Real-time rendering of the L2 orderbook and liquidity distribution.
- **Multi-wallet View**: Aggregated PnL and balance views for the entire swarm.
