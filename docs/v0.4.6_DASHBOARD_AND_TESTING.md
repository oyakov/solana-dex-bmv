# v0.4.6 Dashboard and Testing Overview

Version 0.4.6 introduces a modern Solana DEX dashboard and a comprehensive automated testing suite.

## 1. New Solana DEX Dashboard
- **Backend API Integration**: Real-time data population from the trading bot to the dashboard.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Premium UI design with smooth transitions and glassmorphism.
- **Market Monitoring**: Live tracking of token metrics, grid performance, and wallet balances.

## 2. Localization
- **Russian Language Support**: Introduced a language toggle in the dashboard UI.
- **Automated Validation**: Dedicated E2E tests verify that the UI correctly handles language switching and displays translated content.

## 3. Playwright E2E Testing Suite
- **Location**: `tests/browser/`
- **Coverage**:
  - **Dashboard Flow**: Verifies navigation, stat cards, and chart interactions.
  - **API Validation**: Direct testing of backend control and telemetry endpoints.
  - **Cross-Browser**: Configured for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari).
  - **Responsive Design**: Tests mobile and desktop viewports.
- **Resilience**: Implements lenient assertions and smart waits to handle network latency.

## 4. Environment Configuration
- **Profile Split**: Implementation of separate `local` and `production` configuration profiles.
- **Validation**: Refactored `settings.rs` to support dynamic profile loading via environment variables.
